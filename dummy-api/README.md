## Dummy API For Testing Purposes

This is a Restful API that can be used to test components written in Flutter. I'll try to keep it as close as possible to the real API. Endpoints are going to be same but there might be other endpoints as well in the production API.

### Endpoints

* GET: /users/getAll
* GET: /users/getById/{id}
* GET: /users/getByUsername/{username}
* GET: /misc/articles/getAll
* GET: /misc/articles/getById/{id}
* GET: /misc/quizzes/getAll
* GET: /misc/quizzes/getById/{id}
